This project is a next step on a Skillcrush Vision Board course project.  This site transforms the original finished static site into a responsive and mobile first design.  HTML, images and css are updated.  

The vision board layout is based on the Feng Shui model which sets the content of each square for a different aspect.  This created challenges with overall design. Because this project was undertaken as a functional reminder to myself of my goals, as well as an implementation of skills, I erred on the side of function rather than design for layout of text and photos.

Goal: JS is added to rotate through an array of images and quotes/inspirational text.
